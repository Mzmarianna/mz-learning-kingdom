## ‚ú® **Core Features & Design Philosophy**

*   **Aesthetics & Performance:** The platform will feature a modern and magical theme, with a focus on high performance. We will use lightweight, hardware-accelerated animations and 3D graphics to create an immersive experience without compromising speed.
*   **Gamification:** Learning will be structured as a series of "quests." Students will earn experience points (XP), unlock achievements, and customize their own unique avatars.
*   **User-Centric Portals:** Dedicated portals for students, parents, and tutors will provide tailored experiences and tools for each user group.

## üó∫Ô∏è **Development Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Performance & Visual Overhaul (Current Focus)**

1.  **Integrate High-Performance Graphics:**
    *   [ ] Install `three.js`, `@react-three/fiber`, and `@react-three/drei`.
    *   [ ] Implement a lightweight, animated particle system on the homepage using `BufferGeometry` for efficiency.
    .
2.  **UI/UX Modernization:**
    *   [ ] Redesign the homepage (`app/page.tsx`) to be a modern, engaging landing page.
    *   [ ] Create new reusable `Card` components with modern styling (shadows, hover effects) for quests and content.
    *   [ ] Apply hardware acceleration CSS (`transform: translateZ(0)`) to key UI elements for smooth animations.
3.  **Responsive & Adaptive Design:**
    *   [ ] Ensure all new components are fully responsive across devices.
    *   [ ] Implement adaptive Level-of-Detail (LoD) for 3D elements to optimize performance on mobile.

### **Phase 2: Expanding the World**

*   **Advanced Gamification**
    *   [ ] Complex Quest System (daily, weekly, seasonal storylines).
    *   [ ] Achievement badges and a "Hall of Heroes."
    *   [ ] Leaderboards and Guilds.
*   **Parent & Tutor Portals**
    *   [ ] Parent Command Center with child progress overview.
    *   [ ] Tutor Admin Panel for curriculum assignment.
