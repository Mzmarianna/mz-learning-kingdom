## 💡 MOST COMMON QUESTIONS

### **Q: Do I need to add real AI to Wowl before launching?**
**A:** No! Wowl currently uses smart placeholder responses (keyword-based). They're surprisingly good! You can launch now and add Gemini AI later (5-minute setup). See `/AI_CHAT_SETUP_GUIDE.md`.

### **Q: How do I test Wowl?**
**A:** 
1. `npm run dev`
2. Complete onboarding
3. Look for purple button (bottom-right)
4. Click → Chat opens
5. Type "I want to play a math game"
6. Wowl responds!

### **Q: What hosting should I use?**
**A:** Firebase Hosting (recommended, easiest). Alternative: Vercel or Netlify. All work great!

### **Q: How long does launch take?**
**A:** 2-3 hours following `/QUICK_START.md`. Half-day if you've never deployed before.

### **Q: Can I launch without payment processing?**
**A:** Yes! Start with manual ESA invoicing. Add Stripe later.

### **Q: What about mobile apps?**
**A:** Not needed yet! Web app is mobile-responsive. Build iOS/Android later if needed.

### **Q: How do I update content after launch?**
**A:** Edit files → `npm run build` → `firebase deploy` (or your hosting). Takes ~2 minutes.

### **Q: Where can students see Wowl?**
**A:** 
- Floating purple button on Student Dashboard (always)
- Welcome image in Onboarding Step 1
